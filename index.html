    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Warm Neutral Harmony" - A calming palette using beige, slate, muted teal, and a soft coral accent. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured thematically around four key career archetypes: "The Builders," "The Analysts," "The Guardians," and "The Strategists." This non-linear, role-based approach allows users to explore paths based on their interests rather than following the report's linear structure. A persistent top navigation bar allows users to jump between sections. The "Market Overview" provides initial context with key stats. Each archetype section features a role selector (tabs) to switch between specific jobs. This interaction dynamically updates the content pane, displaying salary charts, skill lists, career path diagrams, and strategic advice for the selected role. This design prioritizes user-driven exploration and comparison, making the dense information from the report more digestible and personalized. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Market Overview Stats (Inform): Displayed as large, dynamic numbers for immediate impact.
        - Role Comparison (Compare): A primary bar chart compares median pay and job growth across all roles, updated by user interaction. Goal: Provide a high-level comparison. Method: Chart.js Bar Chart. Interaction: Tooltips on hover for details. Justification: Bar charts are excellent for direct comparison of quantitative data.
        - Salary Progression (Change): A line chart shows salary growth from entry-level to senior for the selected role. Goal: Illustrate earning potential over time. Method: Chart.js Line Chart. Interaction: Updates dynamically when a new role is selected. Justification: Line charts effectively show trends over a continuous variable (experience).
        - Career Path (Organize): A structured HTML/CSS diagram visualizes the progression from entry-level to advanced roles. Goal: Clarify career trajectories. Method: Tailwind CSS (flexbox/grid). Interaction: Key roles are highlighted. Justification: A visual, non-chart diagram is clearer for showing hierarchical or sequential relationships.
        - Essential Skills (Inform/Organize): Presented as a tagged list. Goal: Quickly convey required skills. Method: HTML/CSS with Tailwind. Interaction: N/A. Justification: Simple, scannable lists are best for this type of information.
